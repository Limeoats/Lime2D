[Lime2D](http://www.limeoats.com/lime2d) is an open source in-game map/animation editor for 2D C++ game development projects.

Since it is an in-game editor, you can edit maps in real-time with your player, collisions, and everything else being rendered. 
You can then switch out of the editor and automatically see your updated map / animations. This will make for extremely efficient 2D level creation.

The editor can be used in any C++ project using SFML on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

### External libraries used
* [SFML 2.4.0](http://www.sfml-dev.org/)
* [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* [TinyXML2](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml2/index.html)

### Installation
You can download the most recent version of the library and header files by going to the [bin/Lime2D](https://github.com/Limeoats/Lime2D/tree/master/bin/Lime2D) folder in this repository.

I've created a video tutorial showing the process of getting Lime2D integrated with your game. There is also a text version for those of you who don't want to follow an entire video.
