# Lime2D
[Lime2D](http://www.limeoats.com/lime2d) is an open source in-game map/animation editor for 2D C++ game development projects.

Since it is an in-game editor, you can edit maps in real-time with your player, collisions, and everything else being rendered. 
You can then switch out of the editor and automatically see your updated map / animations. This will make for extremely efficient 2D level creation.

The editor can be used in any C++ project using SFML on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
